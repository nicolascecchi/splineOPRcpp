\title{Compute Quadratic K-Splines from Segment Lengths and Accelerations}
\usage{
Ksplines(segments, a)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{Numeric vector of positive segment lengths.}

\item{a}{Numeric vector of accelerations, of the same length as `segments`.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
  \item{p}{Normalized positions along the spline.}
  \item{v}{Normalized velocities at segment boundaries.}
  \item{a}{Normalized accelerations (same as input, scaled).}
}
}
\description{
Computes piecewise quadratic spline quantities (position, speed, acceleration)
for a system of segments characterized by given lengths and accelerations.
}
\details{
The function constructs and solves a linear system \eqn{A vtilde = b}, where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{b = (segments * a, 0)} defines acceleration constraints,
  \item \eqn{A} is a structured matrix encoding spline continuity conditions,
  \item \eqn{v} are auxiliary velocity variables.
}

The resulting positions, velocities, and accelerations are normalized so that
the maximum absolute position equals 1 (unless all positions are zero).
