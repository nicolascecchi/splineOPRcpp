\title{Constrained Naive Jump Detector}
\usage{
naive_constrained(signal, K)
}
\arguments{
\item{signal}{A numeric matrix or vector representing the input data.
It is expected to be of shape [N_SAMPLES, N_DIMS].}

\item{K}{An integer specifying the number of changepoints to detect.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the chronologically sorted indices of
  the K largest jumps.
}
\description{
Finds the K largest jumps in the signal's acceleration, measured by the
L2 norm (magnitude) of the third-order differences.
}
\details{
The function computes the third-order difference of the signal (along the
  sample axis), calculates the magnitude (L2 norm) of the resulting vector
  for each time point, and identifies the indices corresponding to the
  K largest magnitudes.
