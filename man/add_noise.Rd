\title{Add Gaussian Noise to Signal (1D or ND)}
\usage{
add_noise(signal, snr = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{signal}{A numeric vector (1D) or a matrix/data frame (ND) representing
the input signal. Each dimension is a column, each observation a row.}

\item{snr}{A numeric value (in dB) specifying the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
Defaults to 30 dB.}
}
\value{
The noisy signal, returned as an object of the same shape and type
  as the input \code{signal}.
}
\description{
Adds independent Gaussian noise to an input signal (vector or matrix) based on
a specified Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Handles both one-dimensional vectors
and multi-dimensional matrices/data frames.
}
\details{
- For 1D signals, noise variance is based on the total signal variance.
  - For ND signals (matrices), the standard deviation of the signal ($\sigma_{\text{signal}}$)
    is calculated from the mean of the variances of the individual dimensions (the diagonal
    elements of the covariance matrix).
