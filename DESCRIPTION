Description: This package computes a quadratic piecewise approximation (quadratic spline) using an approach inspired by dynamic programming.
    The algorithm relies on two key approximations. The state values at each time step are discretized, and a finite set of initial spline speeds is considered at the initial time. 
    The resulting method has a quadratic time complexity with respect to both the number of time steps and the number of state values.
