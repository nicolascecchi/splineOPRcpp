Description: This package computes the quadratic piecewise fit (quadratic spline) using an approach inspired by the dynamic programming strategy.
    The algorithm lies on two approximations. We discretize the states values that can be taken at each time step and we use a finite number of initial spline speed at initial time.
    Its time complexity is quadratic in time and in state values.
